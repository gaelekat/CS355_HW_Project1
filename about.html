      <h1>About us</h1>
      <h2>Where we started and we are</h2>
      <p> Masarap was founded on November 5th, 1999 by owner Gaele Katindig. First established in her home in Laguna, Philippines, Gaele cooked food for her neighbors, family, and friends with her hearts filled with love AND at a discounted rate. Tasting her dishes and food, people from all over her province started placing orders which resulted in high demand. In order to cater to everyone, she  was able to establish her first restaurant in the heart of Manila, Philippines. Through trials and hardship, she was able to feed everyone around her.</p>
      <h2>Where we today</h2>
      <p> On October 28, 2004, Gaele was able to expand her business in the west. Moving to New York, USA, Gaele established her second Masarap location and brought attention to the Filipino cuisine. High profiles and celebrities like Gordon Ramsey and Bobby Flay were able to taste her creations and garnered much attention to Masarap. On March 13, 2020, Gaele was able to open her third location and second US location in Los Angeles, California. Despite the pandemic, Gaele's ability to cook food for everyone around her allowed her to triumph in the end and captivate the hearts around her. Today, she is still going strong to bring the attention to Filipino cuisine.</p>
